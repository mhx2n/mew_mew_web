# TeleQuiz Project Documentation

## 1. Introduction
TeleQuiz is a comprehensive, full-stack web application designed to streamline the creation, management, and deployment of quiz polls to Telegram channels. It leverages AI for content generation and provides robust tools for organizing and exporting quiz data.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1. AI Quiz Generation & Workflow
- **AI-Powered Creation**: TeleQuiz utilizes **Google's Gemini Pro** model through the `@google/genai` SDK. Users can provide raw text, and the AI parses it into structured JSON matching the `QuizQuestion` schema.
- **Context Preservation**: The system remembers the last input text to allow for "Generate More" functionality without re-pasting content.
- **Manual Editor**: A robust interface to fine-tune AI-generated questions. Features include real-time validation of correct option indices and mandatory explanation fields.
- **Image Integration**:
  - **URL-based**: Direct linking to cloud-hosted images.
  - **Storage-based**: Integration with Firebase Storage or external hosting providers.
- **Dynamic Bulk Operations**:
  - **Batch Topic Assignment**: Updates the `topic` field across selected Firestore documents in a single transaction or batch.
  - **Telegram Queueing**: Parallelized sending logic with rate-limit awareness to prevent bot throttling.
  - **Sync-to-Draft**: Instant status update from `pending` to `draft`, triggering real-time UI updates via listener hooks.

### 2.2. Draft & Poll Management
- **Drafts Page**: A dedicated workspace for questions not yet ready for publication.
  - **Persistence**: Drafts are stored in Firestore, ensuring they persist across sessions.
  - **Workflow**: Drafts can be sent directly to Telegram. Upon successful sending, they are moved to the "Sent Polls" list.
- **Sent Polls Page**: A historical archive of all polls successfully deployed to Telegram channels.
- **Real-time Sync**: The application uses Firestore's `onSnapshot` to provide real-time updates across all devices.

### 2.3. Utility Tools
- **CSV Modifier**: A specialized tool to modify CSV exports. It allows users to append custom suffixes to question sections.
- **Enhanced CSV Export**: The CSV export logic has been refined. From the suffix input, `Type` is now strictly set to `1`, while the `Section` is dynamically set based on the user's input (e.g., `bm`, `bn`, `p`, `c`).
- **QBS (Question Bank System)**: A new integration currently in development ("Coming Soon"). It is designed to allow users to store and manage a centralized bank of questions using Firestore. Access is managed by admins.

### 2.4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Admin Tools
- **Hierarchical Access**:
  - **Admins**: Have full system visibility, including global statistics, user directory management, and feature toggle authority.
  - **Regular Users**: Access is strictly limited to authorized "Pages" (Features).
- **Admin Dashboard**:
  - **User Management**: Admins can create, delete, and modify user permissions.
  - **Granular Permissions**: Access is granted per feature (`polls`, `drafts`, `qbs`, `csv-modifier`, `formats`).
- **Admin Stats**: Real-time aggregated data showing total users, total polls sent, and system activity logs.
- **Feature Directory**: A central hub where admins can visualize and test new integrations before rolling them out to users.

### 2.5. Telegram & Bot Execution Logic
- **Secured Credentials**: Bot tokens and Channel IDs are stored in user-specific Firestore settings, never exposed in client-side code repositories.
- **Poll Construction**: The application converts internal question objects into Telegram `sendPoll` or `sendPhoto` + `sendPoll` method calls depending on image presence.
- **Message Templates**: Supports dynamic injection of prefixes/suffixes (e.g., `[Topic] Question?`).

## 3. Branding
- **Logo**: The application features a custom logo (Purple/White Playful Quiz Time branding) used as the favicon, Apple touch icon, and in the authentication headers.
- **App Name**: TeleQuiz.

## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1. Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18+ with Vite.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-first design.
- **State Management**: React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) and custom feature-specific hooks.
- **Animations**: `motion` (framer-motion) for smooth UI transitions.
- **Icons**: `lucide-react`.

### 4.2. Backend & Infrastructure
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (NoSQL).
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication (Google Login).
- **Security**: Firestore Security Rules enforce data ownership (users can only access their own quizzes, drafts, and settings).
- **Deployment**: Deployed on Google Cloud Run.

## 5. Project Structure

- `/src/features/`: Contains feature-based modules.
  - `quiz/`: Quiz generation, editing, listing, and bulk actions.
  - `draft/`: Draft management logic and components.
  - `qbs/`: Question Bank System placeholder.
  - `auth/`: Authentication flow.
  - `settings/`: Telegram bot and channel configuration.
  - `profile/`: User profile management.
  - `admin/`: User and system management for admins.
- `/src/components/`: Shared UI components (Header, Footer, Navigation, ProtectedRoute).
- `/src/lib/`: Utility functions (e.g., `firestoreUtils.ts` for error handling).
- `/src/app/`: Application entry points (`App.tsx`, `AppRoutes.tsx`, `useAppInit.ts`).

## 6. Data Models & Schemas

### 6.1. QuizQuestion
```typescript
{
  id: string; // Firestore Auto-ID
  question: string; // Max 300 chars (Telegram limit)
  options: string[]; // 2-10 options
  correctOptionIndex: number; // 0-based
  explanation: string; // Max 200 chars (Telegram limit)
  status: 'pending' | 'sending' | 'sent' | 'error';
  image?: string; // Optional URL
  topic?: string; // Used for organization
  userId: string; // Relational link to User
  createdAt: Timestamp; // Server side timestamp
}
```

### 6.2. User (AdminUser)
```typescript
{
  id: string; // Firebase Auth UID
  email: string;
  displayName: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'user';
  permissions: string[]; // ['qbs', 'polls', etc.]
  lastActive: Timestamp;
}
```

### 6.3. UserSettings
```typescript
{
  botToken: string;
  activeChannelId: string;
  channels: Array<{ id: string; name: string }>;
  formatting: {
    questionPrefix: string;
    explanationSuffix: string;
    // ... other flags
  }
}
```

## 7. Security & Validation
- **Firestore Rules**: Strict rules ensure that users can only read/write their own data (`userId` matching `request.auth.uid`).
- **Error Handling**: Custom error boundaries and Firestore error handlers (`handleFirestoreError`) ensure that permission issues are logged and surfaced to the user.

## 8. Development Guidelines

### 8.1. Component Development
- All `.tsx` files should be kept under 50 lines of code for modularity.
- Use functional components and hooks.
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling.

### 8.2. State Management
- Prefer primitive values in dependency arrays for `useEffect`.
- Avoid infinite re-renders by not updating state directly in the component body.

### 8.3. Firebase Integration
- Use `firebase-applet-config.json` for configuration.
- Always use `onSnapshot()` for real-time data fetching.
- Implement robust error handling for all Firestore operations.

## 9. Future Improvements
- Complete QBS (Question Bank System) integration with Firestore.
- Add support for more Telegram poll types (e.g., quiz, regular poll).
- Implement advanced analytics for sent polls.
- Add support for more AI models for content generation.
- Enhance CSV Modifier with more advanced data transformation options.
- Improve mobile responsiveness for bulk action tools.
- Implement unit and integration tests for core features.
- Optimize Firestore queries for better performance.
- Add support for custom themes in quiz generation.
- Enhance Telegram channel formatting options.
- Add support for user-defined quiz templates.

## 10. Conclusion
TeleQuiz is designed to be a scalable, secure, and user-friendly platform for Telegram quiz management. By leveraging modern web technologies and Firebase, it provides a seamless experience for creators to generate, manage, and deploy content efficiently. The modular architecture ensures that new features can be added with minimal friction, making it a robust solution for content creators.
